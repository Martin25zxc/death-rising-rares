# Death Rising Rares

I made this PWA while I was doing a course on React JS. That course started at the same time of an event called **“Death Rising”** of the online playing game “World of Warcraft”; during this event, some specific NPC’s (Non Playable Characters) spawn every once in a while at a certain times.

The purpose of this project is to be able to visualize at what specific time those NPC’s are going to spawn.

### Features:

**Search**: it has a “name” filter of the NPC’s.\
**Link**: it provides links to “WoWhead”, an online page specialized on World of Warcraft, which shares a lot of useful information related to the game.\
**Location commands**: it allows you to copy some useful commands to enter the game and see the location of the NPC’s.
